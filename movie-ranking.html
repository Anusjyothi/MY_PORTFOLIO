<h3>Chota Bheem and Krishna</h3>
<p>It is one of the movie that I have watched recently.This one is really brave.Especially charming and loving krishna presence.And it also implys that everything is nothing infront of god</p>
<h3>The Life of Pi</h3>
<p>The movie that is true and beyond true.I love u Richard parker for not eating dear PI.I love this movie as iam also a kind of Pi.</p>
<h3>Nitham oru vanam</h3>
<p>Before watching this, I felt annoying as in teaser the actor was with 4 girls.I hated but had a curious to watch it.After watching...My god...Everybody should watch.It is not just a movie to watch but a truth to explore.</p>
