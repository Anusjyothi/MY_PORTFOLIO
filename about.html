<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Iam a girl of 20 waiting for my actions to bear into sweet fruits.My name is Anusjyothi and it means small light.Yup...! Iam a kind
  of light with light heart, born to change the idea of success that my fate throws at me.And Iam also the one who live every second that
  aligns with my intrinsic values.One of my value that makes me proud  is "Honest".A lovable woman with pure heart.Living the life not
  for enjoying or becoming the happiest one in the world.Living the life of spirituality to enhance it,break lies and find truth.Every second
  my only moto is " TO COMPETE AND WIN MYSELF"
